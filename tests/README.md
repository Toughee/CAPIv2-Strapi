# Postman tests for TravisCI

There are 2 files:

* capiv2.postman_collection.json
* capiv2.postman_environment.json

These are used by either Postman locally or by newman which we use with travisCI to run automated testing on commits. Please see the ../.travis.yml for our travisCI setup.

Also included is the current Postman runner results ran manually to confirm test results, this will be updated from time to time, used in this case as an example showing a working setup.
