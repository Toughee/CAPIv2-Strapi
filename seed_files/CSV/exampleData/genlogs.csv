1,1,1,WOLF IN SHEEP’S CLOTHING 1/4,"Ship Security Log:

I thought this would be a new start, I thought coming out here things would be different.

But now after this I see that nothing has changed. People lie and other people just pay the cost.

lt seems like someone smuggled an illegal animal on board. A dog. They had been keeping it in one of the storage pods, stealing food for it from one of the kitchens. But it looks like that wasn’t enough.

By what we can piece together the dog got out somehow and killed a bunch of people. I mean a real mess. Bite and claw marks all over the bodies. Bite marks on the walls, on the doors, even on the airlocks.

The only thing is, it was found exactly where they had been keeping it all along, and I mean there wasn’t a drop of blood on this thing. If you ask me, this dog didn’t seem like the killing type. That didn’t stop them from destroying it. I asked the captain to keep the case open, to let me investigate, but no dice. He just saw it as open and shut.

I can’t shake the feeling that there’s something we’re missing here."
2,1,2,WOLF IN SHEEP’S CLOTHING 2/4,"Unregistered Log 062:

What sheep they are, these fools of man. How they prance and bleat, knowing nothing of the true nature of things. Blind sheep following blind shepherds. I have been sent as a wolf amongst this flock to teach them the meaning of their existence. They are nothing, sacks of flesh flung out into the cosmos to spread their seed, uncaring children ejected from an uncaring womb. Spreading like a disease, infecting all they touch. So soon all will bleat as they do. They take only the choicest this flock, cast down those that will not follow their sightless herders to nothing. They prey on the weak for their own gains while they preach about unity and togetherness. They shall be snatched, they shall be scattered, they shall be ravaged."

The shepherds hunt but see nothing. They scuttle and scurry and gather their precious flocks to them. But they cannot protect them.

I have opened so many eyes to the ways of things and still they do not see. I have opened them up to new ways, to see what’s inside. But they refuse to heed the lesson. What arrogance they show, as if this was all made for them. What gives this virus that is mankind the right to infect the cosmos?"
4,1,4,WOLF IN SHEEP’S CLOTHING 4/4,"Unregistered Log 412:

The sheep lay out their sacrifices. They think that will sate the wolf’s hunger. They do not see the wolf hunts not for hunger. They are blinded by the lies they tell themselves, the lies that tie the fabric of their tiny little world together. But the cord frays and will snap. The lesson must be repeated…

…until the baying falls silent."

The Captain told the crew the bad news. They’ve known for months now, but until today it’s been on a need-to-know basis. Now it’s out there.

We can’t stop the ship.

I remember telling the captain about the fault; a manufacturing issue that no one else had detected. I felt responsible; after all I’m the ship’s engineer, like my father and his father before him.

All he said was; “We’ll fix it”. Nine months on, we’re nearing our destination and no closer to finding a solution. But, in lieu of a fix, I believe I have an alternative."
6,2,2,NO BRAKES 2/5,"Chief Engineer’s Log:

After all the debates, all the meetings and the arguing, the ship’s council has finally approved the plan. So we’re all systems go. We’re rigging the emergency pods and the life ships to carry as much useful equipment as possible.

The command crew have made all the course adjustments they can to get the ship close to the target. After that we’ll launch all the pods as the ship passes by. With any luck they will all land safely and we can finally call this mission a success.

There’s just one catch. Someone has to stay behind to launch the pods. That person will be stuck on board. One life for many, seems like a good deal. Jean will think I’m crazy, but I volunteered to be that person. Funny, Jean’s always telling me I need to step up to the challenge more, to prove I have what it takes. I’m not sure this is what she had in mind."
7,2,3,NO BRAKES 3/5,"Chief Engineer’s Log:

After weeks of preparation and drills we’re finally getting close. Only a few more days until launch. All adjustments have been made and our trajectory is looking good. I’ve been getting the engineers to double and triple check everything. I want this to go as smoothly as possible. We’ve had our teething problems, which I guess were to be expected. After all the ship wasn’t meant to do this without stopping. I’m getting nervous, if this fails…

There’s another thing. Jean’s pregnant. She doesn’t know that I know. I found the test in the bathroom. With all that’s happening I guess she doesn’t know how to tell me. Maybe she’s afraid that it will affect my judgement.

She might have been right about that. I was going to tell her tonight that I’m the one. But I’m not sure I can anymore. She’ll want to stop me, or worse she’ll want to stay behind as well. I can’t let that happen."

This is Chief Engineer Tom Edwards to the pilot of Life Ship 003. This is a direct order. Secure all passengers and launch now.

Tom, the ship’s leaving. Where are you?

Jean, sweetheart, you have to listen to me. I’m sorry, this is the only way. I couldn’t tell you before. Someone needs to stay on board and make sure everyone gets out of here.

I don’t… Why, why you?

It’s my responsibility. Listen to me. You’re going to be okay. Both of you.

That’s not important. Just know everything is going to be okay. I love…"

We’re out of communication range now; I’ve been sitting here for hours listening to the crackle of the dead signal. I thought I was ready for this. Thought, I had made peace with it, but knowing that that was the last time I was going to hear her voice makes it so much worse.

The captain said they are going to name the first settlement after me. A nice gesture I guess, but I really didn’t do it for them. I did it for her and the life she’s carrying.

This was the right thing to do. There is no telling when or if this ship will ever stop. We had our shot and we took it. I’d gladly do it again.

Our voyage continues apace. All systems fully operational. We had some issues with the hydroponics units, but maintenance has managed to solve that problem. The only other thing to report is the religious fervour that seems to be gripping some sections of crew and passengers. Apparently there’s this boy – I think he’s around ten or something – and people are heralding him as the second coming. There’s a rumour he can perform miracles but it’s obviously only a story. Commander Jefferson wasn’t too impressed when he heard but l managed to calm him down. Toid him it was good for people to have something to believe in… especially on a voyage like this one."
11,3,2,THE PROMISED LAND 2/5,"Midshipman’s Log 57/9:

This situation is becoming critical. Support for the child – they’re just calling him Zachariah – has developed into some sort of mass hysteria. They’re hailing him as a kind of messiah. Over half the ship’s population now thinks this boy is going to deliver them to the promised land. Jefferson has tried talking to his acolytes but they no longer recognise the commander as the main authority figure on the ship. It wouldn’t be so bad but there are whispers of weird ceremonies, and people have started to go missing. l don’t know what Jefferson’s next move is but he needs to do it quick if we’re gonna regain order."
12,3,3,THE PROMISED LAND 3/5,"Midshipman’s Log 59/6:

We have an emergency situation. Commander Jefferson is… he’s dead. They killed him… an offering they called it. He went with a security team to break up one of their gatherings and take Zachariah into custody when they just turned on him. The kid refused to go and ordered the security team to throw Jefferson out of the air lock. I can’t believe they did it! It’s like he has some kind of power I’ve never seen anything like it.

There’s only me and a few others who don’t follow him now, but it’s safer if we just go along with these religious fanatics until they find their promised land and I can ditch them. I don’t want to be the next one getting vented!"

I don’t have much time. He’s going to kill everyone… and I have to stop him. Turns out Zachariah’s ‘promised land’ isn’t a fertile planet. It’s the cold vacuum of space!! He intends to open up every airlock on the ship and vent all the corridors and containment units. He just proclaimed it to the entire ship in that little voice of his. Everyone seems to be going along with it – thinking it’ll take them to a higher plane or some garbage. Am I the only one here still sane? Because it sure feels like it.

I have to stop him. I got a loaded carbine and I’m not going to let anyone get in my way. I just hope I’m in time."

Nothing out of the ordinary to report. Minor injuries, aches and pains from the more vulnerable crew members and the usual bout of influenza you’d expect with so many people living in such close confines. It seems the current strain of influenza is becoming resistant to the vaccines we’ve developed on board.

Only thing of note was a minor injury to one of the survey team. Gottleib sustained a minor laceration. He was taking a mineral sample on a nearby asteroid. The suit got breached but he managed to apply an emergency seal before anything serious happened. I only hope the sample he took was worth the scar it’s gonna leave."
16,4,2,CONTAGION 2/5,"Physician’s Log 2387/8

We have an emergency. The strain of influenza infecting the ship has become completely resistant to any vaccines or treatment we can find. 13% of the ship’s population has now succumbed to the infection and so far eight have died. I’ve initiated emergency measures and quarantined the infected. The epidemiologist, Doctor Munroe, is working round the clock to find a solution – I’rn sure she’ll come up with a cure before long."
17,4,3,CONTAGION 3/5,"Physician’s Log 2463/5

Doctor Munroe made a discovery that has filled me with dread. This contagion doesn’t derive from the influenza epidemic – it’s altogether more alien than that. The contaminant has no human origin – it comes from Gottleib, the scientist who was injured a few days ago. Whatever mineral he was taking a sample of must have got into his blood. It’s mutated into some kind of virulent pathogen. Munroe is unable to isolate the microorganism that’s causing it. It spreads… fast. Quarantine hasn’t worked and people are starting to panic. We’re doing our best to come up with a counteragent but I’m not sure we have the resources…"
18,4,4,CONTAGION 4/5,"Physician’s Log 2499/9

We are lost. Munroe died two days ago and any chance we had of finding a cure for this epidemic died with her. Half the ship’s population is already dead and 98% of those remaining are infected. Teams are working round the clock to vent the bodies into space but they’re piling up so quickly… The riots haven’t helped. People are panicking, angry, don’t know what to do. When you see your family die I guess you just get desperate.

I don’t know what to do. Suppose I should do my job but it’s no use. At least I’ve avoided infection. For now…"

20,5,1,OUR NEW EDEN 1/5,"Odysseus Council Log: Order, order. I will have order in the house.

It is decided then.

The mission is changed.

We, the elected council of The Odysseus, decree that all members of the crew remain on board and all resources for the ill conceived planetary colonisation mission are to be reallocated to enable the Odysseus to sustain us.

Order, order.

Any and all attempts to leave the ship, question the council or otherwise reinstate the previous mission parameters, is to be considered a capital offence. For the greater good."
21,5,2,OUR NEW EDEN 2/5,"Personal Log: First Officer

Why would we leave the safety of our ship for the unknown of an alien world?

We have everything we need here. No one goes without. We have sustainable food, water, medical supplies and power sources for all on board. This is our Eden, not some dust ball hurtling through the vacuum of space. It makes no sense to leave.

Besides we have no idea what we would find on these worlds, if we’d survive, if we’d be able to find food or water. There could be anything out there.

The ship’s council makes the law and they were right all those years ago. That’s why we elected them after all.

The Odysseus is our home and this is where we stay. For the greater good."
22,5,3,OUR NEW EDEN 3/5,"Security Officer’s Log:

It’s been years since we’ve dealt with something like this and to be honest I’m not sure we can cope anymore.

Sickness has taken hold, we detected it too late. By the time we knew what it was, half the ship was infected. Rings A and C are no go areas, even for medical staff. Council orders. So many areas are quarantined off now we’re cut off from some of the ship’s key systems.

We should have been better prepared. It’s not the first outbreak we’ve had. Back in my dad’s day an epidemic flooded the ship after a meteor storm. There were riots and people getting sick. But we got through it. We rebuilt the farms, peopie got medicine and recovered. This… this is different.

The council has initiated martial law, the ship’s under curfew, and anyone found to be infected is locked up in the quarantine zones. They say it’s for the greater good, but I don’t know anymore. I can’t think straight."
23,5,4,OUR NEW EDEN 4/5,"Security Officer’s Log:

lf the sickness killing us all wasn’t bad enough, the council just gave the order, someone flicked a switch and they vented it all. Ring A, C, the med bays, the holding bays, all of it. Anywhere there was a sign of infection. Hundreds of people, sucked out into space. Hundreds more suffocated with no air. For the greater good.

We were raised to believe that the will of the council is absolute. They govern, they rule, for all of us. But this…

There’s talk of a movement to remove the council, they want to get off the ship to leave at the next habitable world. After all these years, none of us have any memory of anything but the Odysseus. It’s a dream. We wouldn’ t know what to do if we got planetside. I’m fifth generation; all I know is this ship, the council, the laws. And I know that going down to an unknown planet would likely be the death of us all. Besides, it will never happen. The council won’t allow it. There is only one way off this ship."

Twenty years, we have existed. But you can’t kill this, it hides, it retreats and mutates and comes at you again.

The same, but different. Stronger, more deadly.

Now there is nothing left; no people, no council, no laws, only the sickness.

25,6,1,THE CHROMOSOME INCIDENT 1/4,"Medical Log 247/4

I’ve researched some statistics and there could be a problem. Over the past three months 75% of pregnancies have provided a male foetus. I’m sure it’s nothing to worry about right now. Although I’m starting to think my predecessor made a mistake not bringing any medical equipment that could manipulate gender at the embryonic stage. I mean I can understand the ethics behind it, but this has left us hanging a little bit. Especially now we’re in this situation. I can only hope it evens itself out."
26,6,2,THE CHROMOSOME INCIDENT 2/4,"Medical Log 320/9

Situation is now critical. We’ve had no female newborns for the past nine months and all recent pregnancies have produced male foetuses. I’rn currently looking into the problem and it would appear that none of the ship’s complement are producing male gametes with the XX chromosome. That means that even if we could artificially inseminate with a sample we still wouldn’t produce any zygotes with the potential to form a female embryo. l have no idea how to solve this as we have no stock with both XX and XY samples on the ship – another mistake my predecessor made. lf I can find out the cause of this anomaly hopefully it will lead me to a solution. We have time to fix this, and I’m not panicking yet, but this has the potential to be disastrous to the success of our mission."
27,6,3,THE CHROMOSOME INCIDENT 3/4,"Medical Log 398/1

After all these years I finally have to come to terms with the fact that we’re never going to find a solution to this problem. The last member of the ship’s complement of child bearing age has now had a boy. She was sixty nine. If I could find a solution, even if I applied the stims and gene therapy that allowed any of them to carry a child, none of the women aboard ship would reach full term anyway."
28,6,4,THE CHROMOSOME INCIDENT 4/4,"Medical Log 537/5

This will be my last entry. The men aboard are preparing to evacuate. They know the mission is doomed and don’t want to die here. I don’t blame them. I could still go with them, but I’ve refused the offer. I failed this ship and everyone aboard. It’s only right that I die with the mission. Good luck to them."

We have an emergency situation on board. Some kind of epidemic, it’s driving people insane. I’ve managed to source it to a digital signal that keeps broadcasting within the comms array. It started on C-Deck, but now the entire population of decks C to F have been massacred. They just went crazy and started killing each other. I’ve isolated the signal, so it’s stopped for now.

That’s the good news. The bad news is, I heard the message. I was trying to run it through the translator and I forgot the speaker was on. It’s the same message relayed again and again and again – it’s more a whisper than anything else; it says, ‘kill them all’…"

This is Officer Gant. I know I haven’t made many of these logs – haven’t needed to – but recent events mean I have to open a record. The Venusian has been travelling for months now without incident, other than the usual canteen disputes and a couple of bar fights. Recently though, sensors have picked up a number of heat signals, though no sign of any actual ships… that is, until today.

Two small ships of unknown designation were briefly caught on sensors until they initiated supercruise and disappeared. We don’t know where they’ve come from or where they’ve gone, and attempts to hail them were met with silence. The XO, Deacon, thinks it’s nothing to worry about but I’ve got to admit, I’m nervous. Anyway, we’re keeping an eye out and the comms team are on high alert. Maybe it’s nothing."
35,8,2,BOARDING PARTY 2/4,"Security Log: Generation Ship Venusian

They came out of a gas nebula, a pirate fleet, all manner of ships and some of them highly modified. Every single one was red though. Blood red. Our auto defences were useless and the raiders breached the hull with mining lasers. By the time they’d got inside I’d managed to rustle up a decent defence force, but we couldn’t stop them spreading through the decks. The fighting was fierce at first and we put up a good resistance, but when the best of our crew were cut down there was nothing the rest of us could do.

All l could do was initiate a rearguard action while we tried to save as many people as we could. Deacon managed to rally some troops and we pushed them back long enough to retreat to aft. Not sure how long we’re gonna last.
Deacon keeps talking about a parlay, but these are pirates on a slave hunt. They won’t stop until we’re all dead or in chains. And frankly I’d take death over slavery any day."

I’m down to my last dozen men and about the same in cells for my carbine. We’ve got around a hundred civilians relying on us and we’ll fight till the last man to defend them.

Deacon’s disappeared. Either fled or captured I don’t know which. I can only hope he managed to escape somehow and has gone to get help from somewhere. Anywhere.

I know, I’m kidding myself. We’re done for, and it’s just a matter of time before they breach our defences. No matter – I’ll fight till the last. They won’t take me alive."

We’ve suffered a critical failure.

lt came out of nowhere, I thought we’d hit something, just a huge bang and then all hell broke loose, system alarms firing off everywhere. All drives are off line, repair attempts are ongoing but with no success.

Evidence points to one of the cooling systems exploding on a routine cycle. It sent pieces flying through the propulsion system, shredding it, chains of explosions and… Well, the long and the short of it is the ship’s a dead stick. We’re drifting, no engine, no means of altering course.

I guess we’re lucky the power plant didn’t go up or we wouldn’t be alive to make reports."
39,9,2,DEAD STICK 2/4,"Lazarus Expedition situation report:

After weeks of repairs we have to accept it. The Lazarus is not going anywhere.

So we have two choices open to us:

We can stay on board, floating aimlessly in space. There are enough renewable resources for generations, but it’s not an infinite supply. The Lazarus wasn’t a top of the line ship. There was only enough capital to get the basic ship built and stocked up for the intended travel time. We added some contingency, but that will only give us say… another ten years. So maybe it’ll be our great grand kids that’ ll have to deal with the problem. I don’t like that idea. I couldn’t bear with it being another generation’s problem to solve, while we use up all the resources.

So that leaves option number two.

We harvest the ship and build as many useable lifeboats as we can. This thing was designed to be dismantled to make our settlements when we reached our destination. Once we have all we need from the ship, we should be able to reach a planet, as long as it’s not too far away. We’ ve done some scans and there are habitable worlds in the region that we can aim for.

It’ll take months, maybe years, but I think it’s the best option. After all, we have the time and giving people hope is a powerful tool."
40,9,3,DEAD STICK 3/4,"Lazarus Expedition situation report:

As the life ship’s near completion, I find I’m sleeping less and less. I tell myself that it’s nerves or excitement at all we’ve achieved. But those are just the lies I tell myself to keep going.

The real reason I can’t sleep is that I know what’s to come. Even with the rules in place, we’ve seen population growth. Unlicensed births are increasing as people see the light at the end of the tunnel. I knew hope was powerful, but I forgot it can also blind you to the truth.

With our current population, we don’t have enough space on the life ships for everyone on board.

So once again, I have choices to make.

It won’t be popular, these things never are. But it will be fair.

There is an old Earth maritime tradition of women and children being evacuated first. We will hold to that We’ll try to keep families together. From those that remain, volunteers will be requested I can only hope that covers the deficit. Otherwise it’II be a lottery for the final places."
41,9,4,DEAD STICK 4/4,"Lazarus Expedition situation report:

The last of the life ships has launched. Each has a destination well within their calculated range. We thought it best to have multiple destinations, not putting all our eggs in one basket so to speak. All we can do for them now is hope, hope that they make it, hope that the planets they land on are hospitable, hope that they thrive and grow.

For us that remained on board there is no more hope. We go about our existence with the knowledge that we are destined to die, but that we do so, so that others could live.

In the end we all volunteered for this. That’s the thing about the human spirit. We fight over the smallest things, but when it really hits the fan, people step up.

This is our last log, I won’t document our demise. This is not our story anymore. It belongs to those out there heading towards a new life. It’s a story of hope, triumph over adversity and how we came together as a community to give them a chance out here. This is the Lazarus Expedition… signing off."

We’ve done it. We’re down on the surface and the habitats are all fully operational. No more supply runs to the ship and back We’ve established five settlements in this region with another ten spread across the other regions. The elected leaders of each group have voted and declared the mission a success. Many of the settlements have decommissioned their landers as a sign of this, even holding ceremonies to celebrate our new life here. However, it appears our new home may not be as welcoming as we had hoped for. Much of the indigenous flora and fauna have proven to be toxic and highly aggressive.

Several of the crew have been attacked while gathering food and supplies and we have lost a few people to various incidents involving local plant life.

Settlement Alpha and Beta have also been having problems with animal attacks. By all accounts they’ve had it worse than us with entire teams being lost.

We’ve posted additional sentries to guard the settlement, but we’re not a military operation, we’re explorers and colonists. The best we have is an ex-security officer to keep us safe. We were simply not expecting such a hostile environment."

We can’t stay here. Correll has gathered up everyone he could find and we’re heading for settlement Delta in the mountains east of here. Hopefully we can find some shelter up there. Correll said something about them keeping the lander intact as an emergency measure. Maybe we can use that to get back to the ship."

We reached Settlement Delta this morning, only… there’s no one here. There are signs of what looks like a fight and barricades in some of the bigger buildings. It looks like they tried to use the main hab as a shelter, but whatever attacked them tunnelled in through the floors.

I can’t shake the feeling that these animals are watching us, biding their time. It feels like we’re being hunted.

At least the rumours about the launcher are true. It’s here and fully intact. It seems as if our friends had turned it into a monument rather than break it down like the rest of us did. We’ve managed to locate the orbiting ship’s beacon and made the necessary calculations for a launch. Our only problem is the fuel cells. They are dry. Huke, our engineer, seems to think he can get some from the other building in the settlement. It will just take a little time, a couple of days maybe. All we can do is wait and keep our guard up until we can get off this planet."

Somehow, I don’t know how, one of those things got on board. It must have been in the lander when we launched.

We’ve managed to trap it in the farm pods, but not before it killed all but three of us. Halil won’t make it through the night, the thing mauled him pretty badly. All we can do is keep him doped up on pain meds. As for Huke and me, without access to the farms, we’re living on borrowed time. We were in the process of setting everything back up when the creature attacked. We only have the few day’s rations that were on the lander… wait… what was that!

No, no, no, no… How did it get out?! This can’t be happening… it can’t be happening…"
46,11,1,TWO TRIBES 1/4,"Ship Log — Year 5, day 234

We have a situation. There have been system failures in navigation, habitat and communications. Life support seems to be working normally, but we only have enough power in bio-systems for a few decades. We’re drifting aimlessly. Assuming we don’t reach a habitable planet soon, we’ll be out of food in a few years. The Captain has ordered us to keep a lid on this. I mean, we’ve got 3,000 souls aboard this vessel — the last thing we need is a ship-wide panic."
47,11,2,TWO TRIBES 2/4,"Ship Log — Year 187, day 12

The War of the Four Tribes continues. We, the Mechanics, are once again fighting for our survival. The Peacekeepers — curse their name — have become dominant. After they allied with the Colony they destroyed most of us. But if we can form an alliance with the Cultivators we might gain control of food stocks and avert our destruction. With prayer and zeal we will prevail. We fight with the wrench and the driver. We fight for the Engine."
48,11,3,TWO TRIBES 3/4,"Ship Log — Year 369, day 327

Still we fight. Still we quest for victory over the Mechlords. I hear them in the long night, creeping through the vents like ghosts. From my earliest days, the Elders told me of their rites and their sacrifices. Never venture out alone, my mother said. But still I do. I have to. What would we eat if we didn’t forage in the bowels of the beast? The Mechlords won’t catch me – I am too quick and too wily. My brood brothers and sisters think me mad, but I don’t care. They’re just scared. Too taken with the old tales. If I see one of those mechs they’ll get full steel to the face, and I’ll be off quicker than starlight."
49,11,4,TWO TRIBES 4/4,"Ship Log — Year 537, day 45

Tonight we feast. The flesh of the vanquished will be our banquet. Few remain, but those who do stand victorious. Unbroken within this tomb…this eternal prison. The Sayers will tell our legend for generations. They will tell of the Last Eaters, of how we rose from the depths of the Engine. How we claimed our throne. But tonight they will feast alongside us. And we will sing forever in the dark with a curtain of light ahead, heralding the journey to come."
50,12,1,THE LAST PEOPLE 1/4,"Warrant Officer Noonan — Personal Log 512/9

I must admit, sometimes our mission seems futile. It’s still difficult to accept that we’re the last humans in the galaxy. But who am I to argue with Command?

Details regarding the end of humanity are scarce, and discussion of it is forbidden. The rumour is there was some kind of cataclysm. Sol was the first to fall, followed by every inhabited system in the core. Plague, famine, war – it could have been anything. All I know is we’re the last vestige of humankind. And we must find a new home if our race is to survive.

Who knows what would have happened without Command. They’ve guided and protected us for hundreds of years. If I prove my worth, maybe one day they’ll ask me to join them. But for now I’m happy to serve in whatever way I can."
51,12,2,THE LAST PEOPLE 2/4,"Warrant Officer Noonan — Personal Log 576/4

Something really weird happened today. I was accompanying Admiral Kerr on a tour of the ship. Actually, it was more a case of pushing his wheelchair while he mumbled about the good old days. Everyone knows the Admiral should have been put out to pasture years ago – he’s certainly not dealing with a full deck. Anyway, he said the strangest thing.

As we were passing communications he suggested we send a progress report to Sol. I tried to explain that Sol was gone, but he was insistent. Then he seemed to clam up, as if he’d said something he shouldn’t have. He was silent for the rest of the tour.

I’m not sure whether or not to mention it to Command. Talk of Sol is forbidden you know, but I don’t want the old man to get in trouble. At his age who wouldn’t be confused?"
52,12,3,THE LAST PEOPLE 3/4,"Warrant Officer Noonan – Personal Log 612/8

The incident with Admiral Kerr really played on my mind, so I decided to do some digging. I shouldn’t have done it, I know, but I just couldn’t stop thinking about what he said. I used his Command clearance to access the ship’s archives. I almost wish I hadn’t now.

We’re not the last bastion of humanity. That was a lie. A deception designed to dupe every man, woman and child aboard the ship.

Our mission should have ended generations ago, but when the ship reached its destination the planet was found to be uninhabitable. Most people wanted to turn back, but Command wanted to continue and find a new colonisable planet. There was an uprising, which was violently brought to an end. Afterwards, they put out reports that we were the last members of the human race in an effort to keep us under control. It was all a lie.

I’m not sure what to do with this information. Would anyone even believe me if I told them?"
53,12,4,THE LAST PEOPLE 4/4,"Warrant Officer Noonan – Personal Log 625/7

I didn’t mean for things to get out of hand, but the people had a right to know the truth. I only told a few people I thought could be trusted – but it spread like wildfire. Within hours, Command was faced with an angry mob threatening mutiny and they responded with overwhelming force.

Over the last few days the ship has been engulfed in conflict. Two factions have emerged – one that wants to return to the core, and one that wants to continue with the mission.

People are dying and it’s all my fault. Why did I tell them? All I can do now is try to stop the killing, before every last person on this ship is wiped out."

58,14,1,THE PRISONER 1/4,"Detainee #947, Collins, Comms Log Day 1

Hello? Can anyone hear me? There’s been a mistake. I’m not supposed to be in here. I only borrowed that data chip. I was going to give it back. Locking me in the brig is completely unnecessary! Where do you think I would go if you let me out? We’re in the depths of the black!

Keep it down In there, Collins!

All right, keep your shirt on. I’m sure we can work all this out. If I could just explain myself to the Captain, he’d realise this is all a big misunderstanding."
59,14,2,THE PRISONER 2/4,"Detainee #947, Collins, Comms Log Day 3

What’s happening? I can hear a siren. Can anyone hear me? I’ve been in here for two days and no one’s come to check on me. Can’t someone tell me what’s going on…please?

Is the ship being evacuated? You can’t leave me behind! You have to let me out of here! I’m not even supposed to be in here!"
60,14,3,THE PRISONER 3/4,"Detainee #947, Collins, Comms Log Day 9

Can anyone hear me? Am I just talking to myself?

It’s been days. Everything’s so quiet. Thank god that siren finally stopped, but now the silence is killing me. Where is everyone?

The automated systems provide me with food and water, and flush away my waste. But for how much longer? Someone will find the ship soon, surely? We can’t just drift through the void forever…can we?"
61,14,4,THE PRISONER 4/4,"Detainee #947, Collins,Comms Log Day 1,047

It’s whispering to me. I can hear it through the air vents. The void is speaking to me. It wants to tell me something, but I can t make out the words. It must be a way out of this prison. A solution to the puzzle.

I’m innocent. They knew I’d done nothing wrong but they put me in here anyway. It was a test — I know that now. Part of some greater game. I just need to find the answer.

How long have I been here? A week? A year? Maybe only a matter of hours. Isolation does strange things to people. A lesser man might have gone insane, but not me. Not Joe Collins.

Joe…Collins. That is me, isn’t it?"
62,15,1,SLINGSHOT 1/4,"Technician Farrow. Work Log 943-56. Gen Ship: Spear of Hope

Looks like one of the long—distance Pathfinder probes has malfunctioned. It wouldn’t normally be a big deal, but we’ve already lost two so they’re becoming precious. Finding a habitable planet depends on having as many working probes as possible. And that means yours truly will have to head out and fix it.

I’m not expecting it to be a challenge from a technical point of view, but the probe is light years away. It will take the maintenance shuttle six months to reach it and another six to get back. So I’ll be on my own for a year.

Maybe someone will let me have their coffee ration."
63,15,2,SLINGSHOT 2/4,"Technician Farrow, Work Log 943-97. Gen Ship: Spear of Hope

I just returned to the Spear of Hope having repaired the Pathfinder drone. There’s just one problem…I’ve returned to a ghost ship. I mean, the whole place has been evacuated.

I’ve checked the data logs and it looks like the crew found a viable planet about eight months ago. The Spear of Hope was going to take them right past it, so they staged an emergency evacuation. According to the log, five thousand people left the ship in about an hour. I guess no one had time to think about one lonely technician out in – the black.

So now I’ve got to work out how to get to them… I always did enjoy a challenge."
64,15,3,SLINGSHOT 3/4,"Technician Farrow, Work Log 944—01. Gen Ship: Spear of Hope

Every-last ship and shuttle is gone. There’s no emergency fuel either. so my shuttle is all but useless. I can’t even tap into the Spear of Hope’s fuel line because it’s powered by a propulsion drive. That said, all is not lost.

I took a look at the engine schematics, and I think I can adjust the ship’s trajectory using a nearby star. The idea is to get close enough to the star’s gravity well to slingshot around it. Hopefully, I’ll be able to put the ship on an approach vector for the planet.

Honestly, I think the chances of it working are slim. But it’s the only chance I’ve got."
65,15,4,SLINGSHOT 4/4,"Technician Farrow, Work Log 944—04. Gen Ship: Spear of Hope

I’ve gone over the numbers…and I think I can make it work. The only snag is that it’ll take a while to reach the next viable star. …and when I say a while I mean a really, really long while. If the numbers are correct, I should reach the planet in…about 93 years.

I’ve run the calculations countless times, but the results are always the same. The next time I see another human being, I’ll be 132 years old. Let’s just hope they’ve built a retirement home on this planet."
